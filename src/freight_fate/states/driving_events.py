        and an exit arms as much as five miles out (further under time
        compression, which is what the arming window is sized in) -- so a
        driver heard the callout and then watched automatic control sit at 40
        for miles of open interstate with the exit nowhere near (tester
        report, Shane, 2026-08-15).

        Instead the cap glides: corridor speed stands until the exit is inside
        the road this truck needs to shed for it, then comes down along the
        deceleration itself, reaching the ramp number a little before the gore.
        The road is priced exactly as the keeper's ease prices it -- a reaction
        budget in real seconds at the speed the truck is doing, and a
        comfortable shed rate under that.

        In REAL miles, not compressed ones. Pricing the road through the
        effective time scale looked prudent and was the same report all over
        again: at high pacing the cap fell under a 65 mph cruise nine miles
        out, so signalling early was itself what slowed the truck (Shane,
        2026-08-15, signalling nine miles before a truck stop). The clock is
        where that problem belongs and is now where it is solved --
        ``Trip._armed_exit_decompression`` puts the trip back on real time
        for the whole approach window, which is wider than this glide -- so by
        the time the cap has anything to say, the miles under it really are
