"""Resuming (or setting) cruise to a high target must ease up, not floor it.

The tester report (Shane): Shift+K resumes cruise to a high remembered target
(85 mph) from low road speed. The old proportional loop saw the whole error at
once and commanded wide-open throttle. On flat ground the fuel governor caps
that -- loud, but harmless. On a downgrade cruise adding fuel while gravity is
already driving the engine toward redline is what fed the over-rev during the
automatic box's between-shift hold, "the engine is screaming at redline".

The fix has three parts, each covered here:

* a working setpoint that eases from the engage speed up to the target at a
  bounded rate, so a big resume error never lands on the pedal at once;
* an RPM ceiling that tapers cruise's throttle to nothing as the engine nears
  the governor, so cruise never feeds an over-rev -- the descent-control and
  retarder staging own the grade;
* an engage gate, so on the open road cruise waits for road speed before it
  engages, the same bridge the zone-preceded automatic resume already gave the
  tester a behaviour he trusts.

Note on scope: a truck left to coast an unbraked 12 percent grade up from a
near standstill over-revs on gravity alone, threading up through the gears --
that is descent-control territory, not cruise, and it happens whether cruise is
off the throttle or not. These tests pin what cruise itself does: at a
realistic rolling resume it never redlines and charges no over-rev wear, and it
is off the throttle near the governor.
